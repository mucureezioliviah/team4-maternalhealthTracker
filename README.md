# team4-maternalhealthTracker
Version 1.1 of the Maternal Health Tracking system has the Login functionality fully implemented but the Admin and Doctor modules have not been fully made.

Version 1.2 of the Maternal Health Tracking has changed the login interface and streamlined the login and logout processes. Now it's time to work on the doctore module in detail.

Version 1.3 of the Maternal Health Tracking has further modified the login page. The foundations of each page in the doctor module have been created i.e the backend Ajax functions have been implemented and now UI is the remaining part.

Version 1.4 of the Maternal Health Tracking - the Doctor - homepage/Dashboard has been traced out and the patient management module has been completely implemented.
